harmony
=======

A fork of mrdoob's procedural drawing tool, harmony.

I was told by a coworker that the tool was broken, so I took it upon myself to fix it as a learning exercise. It was actually a really simple/quick fix, so I didn't really learn anything haha. In order to learn more, I've decided to update harmony to more modern standards. This is where I'll do it!
